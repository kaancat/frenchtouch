## [2025-06-23] – UI Refinements
Goal: Clean up and polish the landing page based on user feedback

  - Added circular white container with shadow and border
  - Added French Touch badge with accent color
  - Now visible on all screen sizes (previously hidden on mobile)

  - Applied low opacity (opacity-15) for subtle watermark effect
  - Set pointer-events-none to prevent interaction interference
  
- ✅ **Layout Improvements:** Enhanced page structure for background integration:

  - Ensured all interactive elements appear above background mascot
  - Maintained responsive design and accessibility

**IMPACT:** The mascot now serves as an integrated brand element that doesn't interfere with the user interface while providing strong visual branding. The watermark effect creates a professional, polished appearance similar to premium SaaS applications.
